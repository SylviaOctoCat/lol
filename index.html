    <h1>Welcome to [title]!</h1>
    <p>Basically, you enter your crush and junk into the text boxes, press
    submit, and if the object of your affections reciprocates, you will be
    notified via electronic mail.</p>
    <p>Also, I'm not responsible for emotional trauma or anything like that that
    happens because of this. You should know what you're getting into. If
    you put somebody in before, but you like somebody else now, or you don't
    really like anybody at the moment, or you figure that it was just a bad
    idea to do this, just fill the form out again, but say you have a crush
    on "None Applicable," and, since Ms. Applicable doesn't really exist,
    problem solved!</p>
    <p>If you want to know more about this, go <a href="about.html">here</a>.
    If you have any questions go to <a href="faq.html"><abbr

    haven't already been Answered, and if they haven't or if you have any
    suggestions or problems, you can email me at <a

    accurately call it an FAQ.</p>
